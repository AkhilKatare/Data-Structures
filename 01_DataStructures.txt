A data structure is a specific way of organizing and storing information in a computer so that it can be used and accessed efficiently.

Types of data structure:
There are 2 different types of data structure, i.e. linear data structure, non-linear data structure.

* Linear DS: 
A linear data structure is a way of organizing data elements in a sequential, single-level order.
For example: array, linked list, stack, queue.

* Non-Linear DS:
Non-linear data structures organize data hierarchically or interconnectedly rather than sequentially.
For example: tree, graph.
